<p>Following from the previous post on <a href="https://ainizecm.github.io/2017/05/tableau-filters---part-i/"><strong>“Tableau filters - Part I”</strong></a>, let’s get down to the nitty gritty how tos!</p>
<p>We start with a graph and a filter, simple.</p>
<p>The following graph shows the percentage of people per state that agree with each of the statements. Each state is a bar, the more on the right the bar is the bigger percentage of the population in that specific state agrees with that sentence.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>First, we will create a new sheet listing of the options in the filter, step by step.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Bring the Dimension you want to show to rows.</p></li>
<li><p>On the Marks box choose the Polygon option.</p></li>
<li><p>Format the sheets setting the borders to None.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/filters1.png" />

</div>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Format the Text as you wish. I like centering and making it grey and bold but that is a personal preference.</p></li>
<li><p>Add it to the Dashboard and click on the top right of the sheet, where you can see a filter icon. <img src="/img/useasfilter.png" /></p></li>
</ol>
<p>So far you will be able to use the sheet as a filter for your other graph by clicking any of the names.</p>
<p>Do you want to still make it a bit nicer and use icons instead or words?</p>
<p>Let’s see how we can do that.</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Find the icons you want to use and save then on My Tableau Repository/Shapes.(In this case I googled USA states flag icons and download them.)</li>
</ol>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/tableau%20repository.png" />

</div>
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Open the sheet again and change the Marks type to Shape.</p></li>
<li><p>Drag the Dimension into the Shape box.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the Shape box and assign a shape to each name. (Note: If you can not see the shapes you have just added try clicking on Reload Shapes.)</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/Set%20shapes.png" />

</div>
<ol start="10" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Dis-select “Show Header” from the dimension on rows. <img src="/img/show%20header.png" /></li>
</ol>
<p>We are all done, you can now click on the icon in order to filter your view!</p>
