Hi! I am Ainize, a data visualization, analytics and science passionate, but also a curious explorer of frameworks, models a innovation and ideas. 

Basically anything that has to do with **A**nalytics and **IN**spirational **I**deas.

 
Explore around!
 <!--more-->
On my learning and discovery journey, I felt a need of a platform where I could collect my main thoughts and findings, in order to create a space for reference and inspiration. And why not, share them with others.


 
You can get tips and tricks on tools (as Tableau, Alteryx, R or Python) or read about trending topics and ideas (as Design Thinking, Decision Making Frameworks) on my blog, check past talks or know more about my projects.


Feel free to connect with me  on [**linkedin**] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/ainizecidoncha) on [**twitter**](https://twitter.com/ainize_cidoncha) or at **ainizecm@gmail.com**.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
